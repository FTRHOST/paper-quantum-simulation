# Quantum Algorithm Simulation with Cirq

This repository contains source code and assets for the paper:
**“Implementation and Analysis of Deutsch-Jozsa and QFT Algorithms on a High-Performance Quantum Simulator”**

Author: Muhammad Fathir Al Faruq

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of basic quantum algorithms using Cirq and Qsim. All simulations are run in a Jupyter notebook that can be executed in Google Colab.

## How to Run
The main notebook is `Quantum_Computer_Simulation.ipynb.ipynb`. You can run it directly in Google Colab by clicking the badge below:
